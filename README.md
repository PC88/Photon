Photon Ray-Tracer

4th Year Hons Project, aim to create a number of Ray-Tracing performance demos between various types of Ray-Tracers. Including exploration of techniques utilising DXR, primarily photon-mapping to disply Caustics.

The initial port is from Peter Shirleys RT1W serise: https://raytracing.github.io/

and the specific branch of creation is: https://github.com/PC88/CPU_RT/tree/Photon_start_branch

Initial renders of this branch are detailed below, 10 samples per pixel and 10000 samples per pixel for comparison.
